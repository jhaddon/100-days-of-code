# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Sept 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked with React to create my first multi-file project. Lots of importing/exporting, iterating over arrays, and CSS.

**Thoughts:** Two of my least favorite things, CSS and array methods! Gotta keep on keeping on until they click mentally.
